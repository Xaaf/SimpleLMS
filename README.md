# SimpleLMS
> It's 2023! LMS doesn't need to be complicated anymore!

SimpleLMS is a project to strengthen my PHP skills. Its origin lies in a family member struggling with finding an LMS that fit their specific needs, as most other LMS' out there are either super expensive, or super complicated. It's 2023, so why is it still so complicated? SimpleLMS aims to provide an easy-to-use experience for people who want to put courses on their WordPress websites.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To install SimpleLMS, you can go one of two routes.

### 1. Install through WordPress
The easiest way to install SimpleLMS is to install it through WordPress itself! Simply click on the `Plugins` tab, click `Add New` and search for SimpleLMS. Once installed, hit the `Activate` button, and you're good to go! [Check our wiki for the next steps]()!

### 2. Manual Installation
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning** Installing the plugin this way, uses the latest source. This means that you will most likely encounter bugs and other issues, that other users might not! You have been warned...

You can also choose to manually install the plugin - maybe you want to have the latest, cutting-edge features. Installing the plugin this way is also really simple. You can opt for two ways of downloading it.
